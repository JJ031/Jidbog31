I have learn a lot about media during my 6 lessons on it especially on the different positive and negative impacts of it.Creating my identity map, was very hard as I had to think about what to write down and how to write it.Commenting on the other identity maps of my fellow peers was difficult, as I didn't want to say anything that would trigger their feelings.Commenting from online to one to one is a lot different as online messaging is easier as people might not know who you (in this case youtube) are and might not know anything about you, also youtubers can’t do anything about negative comments towards them and they can’t do anything about it.  

I think this way was better as the messages were different, whereas online everyone might gang up on just one person.

Today, we looked at a series of videos, starting with a young couple wanting to upload a youtube video and trying to get as many views as they possibly could get, then the girl's brother came into the room and challenged them to see who could get to a million views first, the young couple filmed a cinnamon challenge whilst the brother filmed a video which was not so mature. The couples video wasn’t working, they went to a party and the boy, filmed an inappropriate event between the brother and his girlfriend. The boy posted it on youtube and the brother saw it, his girlfriend was upset about the video and she was affected and do were the others, the girlfriend of the brother needed help so she got help from childline, the friend of the brother who was in the first video went to CEOP, child exploitation and online protection. This video showed how not to handle situations and how to take them to a level you don’t want to go to.
