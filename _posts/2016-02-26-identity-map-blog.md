I have learn a lot about media during my 6 lessons on it especially on the different positive and negative impacts of it.Creating my identity map, was very hard as I had to think about what to write down and how to write it.Commenting on the other identity maps of my fellow peers was difficult, as I didn't want to say anything that would trigger their feelings.Commenting from online to one to one is a lot different as online messaging is easier as people might not know who you (in this case youtube) are and might not know anything about you, also youtubers can’t do anything about negative comments towards them and they can’t do anything about it.  

I think this way was better as the messages were different, whereas online everyone might gang up on just one person.
