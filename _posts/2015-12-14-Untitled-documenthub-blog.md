Github Blog 

In this lesson I learnt how to produce the art and creativity of my blog website. 

I struggled at first but then I got used to it.I copied and pasted the codes from the colour website w3schools and I chose a variation of colours. 

I couldn't get it to work at first,but now I got it to work and my website is creative and filled with blogs. 

Github Blog 

In today's lesson, I learnt a new way of creating of a blog. The website we visited was called Github. The things I felt well about today was my think flexibly. I found it quite easy to think myself. The thing I couldâ€™ve improved on was my timing, I maybe need to be aware of my timing.
