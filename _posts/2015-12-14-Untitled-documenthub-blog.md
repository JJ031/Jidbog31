Github Blog 

In this lesson I learnt how to produce the art and creativity of my blog website. 

I struggled at first but then I got used to it.I copied and pasted the codes from the colour website w3schools and I chose a variation of colours. 

I couldn't get it to work at first,but now I got it to work and my website is creative and filled with blogs.
