         Changing Colour   

**Today, we carried on with the fuze box project 1, me and my partner, were halfway through the first project, we had to follow the book which showed us how to change the colour of our text and how to change the background. We experimented with the colours and tried to make our text as clear as possible. We had to edit our code to make sure the text was not too fast but not too slow. In addition we had to make our code function to finish this project we completed this task in about 10 minutes as we read the instructions carefully. Then we saved our work on a USB stick which we will have to keep for later projects.                                          **
