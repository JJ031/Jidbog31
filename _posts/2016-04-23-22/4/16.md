In today's lesson, I explored a website called BBC micro:bit where I started to create codes for a computer using a tutorial. There were different types of tutorials to go on and they all had different ways of building. One of the tutorials was called Flashlight where I had to add a new event to use as a starting point and then progressed by adding 'if’ bars to add onto the code, for example ‘if A key pressed , start again’. I learnt how to create a simple code by using my past knowledge of making a code from Scratch when I was using the programme to create a game. A lot of your brain was needed for this task as you had to  flexible by adding and taking away new bars.
