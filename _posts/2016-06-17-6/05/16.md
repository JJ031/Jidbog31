                         6th of May 2016

Today, I was finishing off the Microbit tutorials 3-4. At first it didn't make much sense, but then it gradually started to become more simpler. The tutorials were quite easy, but new code pieces started to appear in the tutorials. The most common code piece was  the 'ifâ€™ code piece, this code piece determined a lot as it made the microbit work in different scenarios. This task was fairly challenging but I used my past knowledge and used that to expand my thinking and learning. In addition I added extra points to expand my Microbit learning.
