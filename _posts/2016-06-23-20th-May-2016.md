20th May 2016 

Today, I finished of my tutorials, including the extension work. Me and my friend completed this work together, helping each other in parts where we did not understand. Today I was challenged, but it helped me to understand Microbit. I felt fairly confident as I was able to complete the previous 6 tutorials in quick succession and I worked efficiently and I worked to a time limit, I didn't rush it and i didn’t take too long on them. I didn’t make too many mistakes in my work, but some of the tutorials , I had to re-do them as some of my coding in the brackets was incorrect.
