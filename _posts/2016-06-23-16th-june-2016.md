**16th june 2016 **

**Today, I started on my Game- Identical- on microbit, javascript, I used my game plan and flowchart to construct my game. Furthermore , I used extra code pieces in my game. I started the simple structures of my game. In addition, I used varied code pieces to make my work better. It was a simple idea, but it was effective, in the way that it actually had a good reason of why i wanted to play it.**

**I enjoyed using javascript as it really taught me how computer coding functions and to utilise them skills into creating a game from scratch. **
