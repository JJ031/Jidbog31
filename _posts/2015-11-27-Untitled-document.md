In today's I.T lesson,what I found quite simple was the timing,normally I rush and get it wrong but in this particular lesson,I felt I was more flexible in timing wise and in getting it right.There were also some moments when I struggled.I struggled in small parts,such as reading mistakes.In this lesson,I have learnt how to post up blogs using a simple method and a simple website.
