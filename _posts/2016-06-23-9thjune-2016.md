9th june 2016 

Today, I started creating my planning sheet for my game. The game planning sheet had to include the game name, the aim of the game, the Inputs and Outputs, the processes and the variables.We also looked at Lucidchart, a special specific flowchart programme, which had special shapes corresponding to the Inputs, Outputs and processes. My initial game idea was to do something on patterns, so I thought of a game to test your memory , using patterns. My idea was for microbit to show 2 patterns and then ask the player if they were identical or different, if they answered correctly they would get a +1 on their score.
