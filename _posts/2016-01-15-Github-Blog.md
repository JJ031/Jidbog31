Github Blog 

In today's lesson,we looked at a tv ad and we had to analyse the video and see what was the key message in the video and who it was targeted to. Also, we played media bingo which was fun as you had to ask people questions such as,Can you paint? as paintings are a type of media as they can show messages from the base background of it. 

For our homework, we were tasked to watch adverts and choose one to answer three questions our teacher told us to answer. At first I was not sure about different types of media but then I got the hang of it.
