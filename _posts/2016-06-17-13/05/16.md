This I.T lesson, I finished the tutorials on Microbit. They were quite challenging so I did them with my friend who sat next to me. Tutorial 5 included a lot of new code pieces and a lot of them were put together to create longer code pieces. A lot of the code made sense to me whereas some code were not familiar to me. In this lesson, I learnt how to add more than 3 code pieces together to make a senseful code and a code that was easy to read and understand. I also learnt that most of the codes have to be in the specifically shown brackets on the screen.
