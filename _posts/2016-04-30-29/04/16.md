In today's lesson, we looked at a short clip of the part of the sorting hat from Harry Potter , which linked to our task. Our task was to create a sorting hat using micro:bit, using a special tutorial which showed us all of the different chunks in this special programme. I learnt how to add multiple chunks together, creating a code to function the programme. Furthermore the homework set for the lesson was to use the skills we learnt in the classwork and transfer them over to a task where we had to create a generator for the schools 6 different houses.

Today, I was finishing off the Microbit tutorials 3-4. At first it didn't make much sense, but then it gradually started to become more simpler. The tutorials were quite easy, but new code pieces started to appear in the tutorials. The most common code piece was  the 'ifâ€™ code piece, this code piece determined a lot as it made the microbit work in different scenarios.
