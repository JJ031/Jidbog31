                      **  ****Receiving our Microbits**

**Today, we received our Microbit's. We had to read the instruction manual, to work out how to download our game onto it. The Microbitâ€™s were very small and fragile so we had to hold them carefully. After we downloaded our game onto the Microbit, we played with our Microbit game to see if they were simple but effective enough. I was very satisfied with my game because it worked well and presented well. On my game, an image appeared and then you had 5 second to memorise the image. Then the game gave you another image and you had to answer the question, Is the image the sam? **

**Target: My target is to learn all of the computing terms and phrases I used in this project to help me in later projects. **
