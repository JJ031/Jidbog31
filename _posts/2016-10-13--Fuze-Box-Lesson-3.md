Today, me and my partner we did some more work on fuze box This time my partner and I did Project1.2 which we finished in the lesson, with not much trouble doing it.We also managed to save our work on an USB stick. Project 1.2 was about adding and subtracting on fuze box. We found it quite easy, and we were very comfortable with this task. We Started on Project 1.3 but didn't do much on that.
