          **       24TH JUNE 2016   **

**Today, I was still working on my game on Microbit. I was adding more detail to it, as last week I worked on the base of my game, the structure. There was one error in my game, due to my misplacement of code in the brackets. I checked everything once over, then I pressed run to see if it worked. As it did, I went back to it, to add new levels and expand my work into different areas. **

**Furthermore, my game was quite a simple idea, but it worked well and made sense. There were quite a lot of games to choose from, but a lot of people mostly thought of the same idea for their game.**
