       What Is a Fuze Box?

**Today, we started working on the fuze box, which had a mouse and a power supply also it had a manual book which gave us some starter projects. The first thing we had to do was to listen to my IT teacher and take some notes which he provided in his talk. The talk was about how the fuze box functioned and worked. We had to partner up in our class. The first project was a printing project where we had to enter code to function our printing our code was: Cycle**

**        Print "Hello World" **

**        Repeat  **

**I was familiar to this type of coding as we studied Github and also made some games on microbit last year in year 7. **
