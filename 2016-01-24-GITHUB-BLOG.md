GITHUB BLOG 

In today's lesson  we looked at the fantasies and realities of a pepsi advert.We also looked at a McDonalds video which showed the difference between a burger which is made at the store and a burger thatâ€™s made with the same    ingredients but made outside the store. The effects on the burger outside the store were slightly altered. We also played a game about disagreeing and agreeing about different scenarios the game was targeted to ourselves not anyone else it was our own opinion.
