Today, we looked at some of the easter homework set on prezi. The task was to create a presentations on computers. We had to research some of the topics that linked to computers and we had to show how they linked used presentation slides. In addition, we reviewed the other peoples work as a class. We were spotting the mistakes such as Capital Letters and the Vocab which were left out in the presentations. The homework set, was to assess others work using a Blog assessment on others Blogs.
