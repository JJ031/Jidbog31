Today, we looked at a series of videos, starting with a young couple wanting to upload a youtube video and trying to get as many views as they possibly could get, then the girls brother came into the room and challenged them to see who could get to a million views first, the young couple filmed a cinnamon challenge whilst the brother filmed a video which was not so mature. The couples video wasn't working, they went to a party and the boy, filmed an inappropriate event between the brother and his girlfriend. The boy posted it on youtube and the brother saw it, his girlfriend was upset about the video and she was affected and do were the others, the girlfriend of the brother needed help so she got help from childline, the friend of the brother who was in the first video went to CEOP, child exploitation and online protection. This video showed how not to handle situations and how to take them to a level you donâ€™t want to go to.
