Prezi Blog

Today, we looked at a new presentation website creator called Prezi. Prezi takes you into a new dimension with a new way of showing presentations using different methods. There are a lot more animation options in this website and there are limited colours to use, but only black and white are there whereas three colours is what you have to choose. Using colours that work with each other makes your presentation more appealing to others.
